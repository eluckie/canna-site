# Canna Site

#### By E. Luckie ☀️

#### This site was created to practice using React to make single-page sites that use local and shared state to be dynamic.

## Technologies Used

* React
* Redux
* JSX
* JavaScript
* Markdown
* Git

## Description

Build a website for selling merchandise for a band, author, sports team, or any other purveyor that interests you.

A user should be able to do the following:

* Create, Read, Update and Delete items in the store. Items should have fields for ``name``, ``description``, and ``quantity`` (along with any other fields you wish to add).
* Increase or decrease the ``quantity`` of an item in the store. For instance, if a user clicks "Buy", the ``quantity`` will decrease by one. If a user clicks "Restock", it will increment by a specified number.
* When the ``quantity`` of an item is reduced to ``0``, the item should say "Out of Stock". A user should not be able to reduce the ``quantity`` of an item below ``0``.
